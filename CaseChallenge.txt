We want to know and compare the various amounts of films
we have per movie rating.

SELECT 
	SUM(
		CASE rating 
			WHEN 'R' THEN 1 ELSE 0
		END
	) AS "Rating: R", 
	SUM(
		CASE rating
			WHEN 'PG-13' THEN 1 ELSE 0
		END
	) AS "Rating: PG-13",
	SUM(
		CASE rating
			WHEN 'PG' THEN 1 ELSE 0
		END
	) AS "Rating: PG"
FROM film;
